 * ATTENTION: An "eval-source-map" devtool has been used.
 * This devtool is neither made for production nor for readable output files.
 * It uses "eval()" calls to create a separate source file with attached SourceMaps in the browser devtools.
 * If you are trying to read the output file, select a different devtool (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/)
 * or disable the default devtool with "devtool: false".
 * If you are looking for production-ready output files, see mode: "production" (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/).

By framework, we mean Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.
